# React-BadBank

Description: This project uses React, Bootstrap, and Freepik as resources to put together a BadBank example. Functionalities for this project include creating an account, logging into an account, depositing into a balance, and withdrawing from a balance. Validation is included to check login credentials, correct value for deposit, and sufficient funds for withdrawal. 

How to Run: To use this project, clone the repository to your local machine and host a local server to run the React component.

Roadmap: This project can evolve to include checking credentials for when users are not logged in, only the Create Account and Login are available on the navigation, and once users are logged in, only the Deposit and Withdraw functionalities are available. Additionally, account roles could be included so only manager roles can see All Accounts listed.
